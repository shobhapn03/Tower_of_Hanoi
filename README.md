# Tower_of_Hanoi

This project implements the Tower of Hanoi<br>
puzzle using recursion in Python.<br>
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical problem that involves moving a set of disk from one peg to another<br>
while following specific rules.<br>

FEATURES : <b>

. Uses recursion to solve the problem efficiently.<br>
. Allows user input for the number of disks.<br>
. Displays step-by-step moves for solving the puzzle.<br>

HOW TO RUN THIS CODE : <b>

Step 1 : Download the zip files.<br>
Step 2 : Extract the files.<br>
Step 3 : Open the extracted folder in Visual Studio Code.<br>
Step 4 : Download mentioned modules(turtle,time).<br>
Step 5 : Run the code in Pycharm or Visual Studio Code.<br>

turtle : <b>

The turtle module in Python is a standard library<br> 
for creating graphics and drawings using a virtual pen (turtle).<br> 
It provides functions to control the turtleâ€™s movement and appearance.<br>

time : <b>

The time module in Python provides functions for handling time-related operations,<br> 
such as retrieving the current time, pausing execution, and measuring time intervals.<br>
It includes functions like `time()`, `sleep()`, and `strftime()` for working with timestamps and delays.<br>

HOW IT WORKS : <b>

1. Move n-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary.<br>
2. Move the nth disk from Source to Destination.<br>
3. Move n-1 disks from Auxiliary to Destination.
